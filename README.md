# My To Do List
 This is my version of the old classic for every developer. :] <br><br>
 Some of the **cool** features of this App:
 - every Entry can be **edited**, **deleted** and **completed** by clicking either one of this three buttons ✏️, ❌ and ✅
 - if you click the **edit** ✏️ Button you get a **popup message** "**Edit this task:**" and there you can edit the Entry
 - if you click the **delete** ❌ Button you get a **popup message** "**Are you sure you want to delete this task**?" that you have to confirm (*so no accidental deleting is possible*)
 - if you **completed** a Entry (*by clicking the **complete** ✅ Button*) the Entry gets a beautiful 🟩 color, to indicate that the Entry is **completed**
 - if a Entry is **completed** the Browser gives you a **popup message** "**Good Job! :)**" and after that the ✅ and ✏️ Buttons of this Entry are **disabled**
  - all of your Entrys are **saved** in the **localStorage** of your Browser (*so dont worry you dont lose your personal List if you reload the Page*)
 - the Inputfield is **autoselected onload** (*even if you reload the Page*) and after every new Entry, too
 - every Button of the App has a little **hover effect** to indicate that you are on the Button
 - **and the most important feature for sure** it has a **Darkmode** option (*by clicking the 🌚 button you activate it*)
