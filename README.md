# My To Do List
 This is my version of a To Do list. :) <br>
 Some of the **cool** features of this app:
 - every Entry can be **edited**, **deleted** and **completed** by clicking either one of this three buttons ✏️, ❌ and ✅
 - all of your Entrys are **saved** in the **localStorage** of your Browser (so dont worry you dont lost your personal List if you reload the Page)
 - the Inputfield is **autoselected onload** (even if you reload the Page) and after every new Entry,too
 - if you **completed** a Entry the Entry gets a beautiful 🟩 color, to indicate that the Entry is **completed**
 - if a Entry is **completed** the browser gives you a **popup message** "Good Job! :)" and after that the ✅ and ✏️ buttons are **disabled**
 - if you click the **delete** ❌ Button you get a **popup message** "Are you sure you want to delete this task?" that you have to confirm (so no accidental deleting is possible)
 - it has a **Darkmode** option, by clicking the 🌚 button you activate it
